## ABOUT
Hello there! This is a simple webpage I made for the TOP (The Odin Project) foundations course. Technically, this is not my first website that I created using HTML, I've created lots of it in my junior high school years. However, this is my first project as someone who is starting to explore the coding/programming world! 

This webpage contains recipes that I personally enjoy which contains the instructions and ingredients needed. That's all!
