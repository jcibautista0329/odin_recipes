## ABOUT
Hello there! This is a simple webpage I made for the TOP (The Odin Project) foundations course. Technically, this is not my first website that I created using HTML, I've created lots of it during my junior high school years. However, this is my first project as someone who is starting to explore the coding/programming world! 

This webpage contains recipes that I personally enjoy which contains the instructions and ingredients needed. That's all!

## PROGRESS
I unexpectedly experienced some problems as I push my recipe files (LOL) but in the end I have solved it! I think I have spend 4 to 5 hours in this project. It was quiet fun!
